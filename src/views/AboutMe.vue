                    I'm currently in the third year of my apprenticeship as a software engineer at the company <wbr/> <a  class="underline underline-offset-2 cursor-pointer" href="https://www.roche.ch/">F. Hoffmann
                    La-Roche AG.</a> <br />
                    I have experiences in full stack development with <span
                        class="underline underline-offset-2 cursor-pointer" @click="scrollTo('experience')">Java</span> and <span class="underline underline-offset-2 cursor-pointer" @click="scrollTo('experience')">Angular</span>
                    and
                    <span class="underline underline-offset-2 cursor-pointer" @click="scrollTo('experience')">Vue</span> <br />
                    I am always motivated to learn new technologies and expand my existing skills. <br />
                    What I love most about my job is that I have to solve new problems every day and can broaden my
                    experience in the process.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I could already gain very valuable experience with 2 web projects in the company.<br />
                    I have also been able to expand my experience through various private projects. <br />
                    Currently, I am trying to gain some experience in the field of data analysis.

                    On my private laptop, I use Debian as operating system. <br />
                    However, I also have no problems working with Windows or MacOS. <br />
                    By using Linux on my personal device and by maintaining some private servers, <br />
                    was I also be able to gain experience in the area of server setup and maintenance.
